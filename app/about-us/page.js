      <p className="font-bold text-[1.2rem] mb-15 max-w-[600px]">Our story dates back 
        to April of 2022, where four students from Minerva University came together 
        to develop and share the beautiful stories of their classmates all around the world.</p>
      <p className="font-bold text-[1.2rem] mb-15 max-w-[600px]">
      In August 2022, Napkins published its first issue and received overwhelmingly positive 
      feedback, both from students and professionals from outside the Minerva community.</p>

      At Napkins Magazine, we proudly publish creative works from the talented individuals 
      associated with Minerva University, including students, staff, and alumni. We publish 
      three times a year, during the Fall, Spring, and Summer seasons. We hibernate in the winter. üêª</p>
